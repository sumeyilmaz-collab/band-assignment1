# “Fyodor Dormant”

Beirut has released a new single as part of the *Artifacts* collection, bringing warm brass tones and nostalgic melodies back into the spotlight. Although the track is newly presented within this compilation, it carries the emotional depth and cinematic feeling that longtime fans immediately recognise.

The single opens with a gentle, muted brass arrangement that slowly grows into a fuller, richer sound. Subtle percussion and soft piano notes create an atmosphere that feels both reflective and hopeful, echoing the intimate storytelling Beirut is known for.  
What makes **“Fyodor Dormant”** stand out is the balance between its delicate structure and its expressive, almost dreamlike layering.

Listeners familiar with earlier Beirut albums will notice familiar textures—European folk influences, warm acoustic tones, and Zach Condon’s signature melodic phrasing—yet the track also carries a quiet maturity that suggests growth and evolution.  
It feels like rediscovering an old memory, reshaped with new colours.

## Highlights

- Nostalgic brass sections with emotional depth  
- Gentle rhythmic build-up  
- A cinematic, atmospheric sound true to Beirut’s roots  

> “A beautifully preserved piece of Beirut’s musical identity.”
