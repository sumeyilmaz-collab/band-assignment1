        Beirut is an indie folk band led by Zach Condon, known for blending
        Eastern European brass sounds with melancholic pop melodies. The band
        has moved from bedroom recordings to international tours, keeping a
        warm, organic sound even as their arrangements and instruments have
        evolved. This fan page focuses on their live shows, albums, and the
        stories behind the music.
