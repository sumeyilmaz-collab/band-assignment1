# Announces a new tour

Beirut has announced a brand new tour for 2026, bringing their warm brass sound and cinematic melodies to a series of carefully chosen venues. Instead of huge arenas, the band has selected theatres, old concert halls and small clubs where the atmosphere can stay close, quiet and emotional.

The tour will mainly take place during the colder months, when city lights and winter air naturally match the band’s nostalgic mood. Audiences can expect a setlist that travels through every era of Beirut’s discography: early favourites from *Gulag Orkestar*, fan classics from *The Flying Club Cup*, intimate pieces from *No No No* and a few surprises from recent releases.


## What to expect from the 2026 shows

- A mix of well-known songs and rarely played deep cuts  
- Expanded brass and accordion sections for a fuller live sound  
- New arrangements that give older tracks a fresh character  
- Visuals inspired by winter cities, old postcards and warm indoor lights  

Tickets will be released in several waves to keep things fair for fans in different countries. Newsletter subscribers will receive early-access codes, while a limited number of seats will be reserved for smaller local communities and independent record shops.

Whether you first discovered Beirut through **“Postcards From Italy”** or a recent single, the 2026 tour is designed to feel like a shared story: one night of trumpets, waltz-like rhythms and quiet sing-alongs that you carry home with you long after the lights go down.
